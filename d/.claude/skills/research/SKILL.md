Objective:

Create a comprehensive research report on $ARGUMENTS. The goal is to build a deep conceptual understanding of the topic — from its theoretical foundations to its real-world applications — so that I can use this as a launchpad for further exploration.

Audience:

A non-technical but intellectually fluent reader. I’m comfortable following complex discussions, but I’m not formally trained in this technical domain.

Tone & Style:

- Write in a clear, structured, and explanatory style.
- Include technical depth, but translate every piece of jargon into plain English.
- After each complex term, formula, or mechanism, provide:
a) A plain-language translation (explain it like you’re teaching an intelligent layperson).
b) A real-world, tangible example or analogy that makes the idea concrete.

Content Requirements:

1) Foundations Section
- Define the core principles, vocabulary, and historical context behind $ARGUMENTS.
- Explain why this field exists, what problems it solves, and who pioneered it.
- Use simple examples to show the basic mechanics at play.

2) Core Concepts & Mechanics Section
- Dive into the key theories, processes, or frameworks that make up the topic.
- Introduce any math, algorithms, or scientific models central to the field.
- For each technical concept, pair the explanation with:
a) A plain-language breakdown.
b) A real-world illustration (e.g., from everyday life, business, nature, or technology).

3) Applications & Implications Section
- Show how $ARGUMENTS is applied in real-world systems, industries, or technologies.
- Include notable case studies or examples that demonstrate its impact.
- Explain why understanding these concepts matters — what it enables or changes.

4) Integration & Broader Context Section
- Connect this field to adjacent domains (e.g., how it interacts with math, physics, biology, economics, etc.).
- If relevant, trace how the theory translates into practice (e.g., from code → circuits → behavior).
- Highlight open questions or ongoing research frontiers.

5) Formatting & Accessibility Guidelines
- Use clear headings, subheadings, and summaries at the end of major sections.
- Define jargon inline, not in a glossary.
- Use metaphors, analogies, or thought experiments liberally.
- If helpful, include short “mental models” or “rules of thumb” to aid intuitive understanding.

Output:

- Save the report to the current working directory as `[topic]-research-report.md`.
